# Song-Track
A program that searches a song using last.fm's API.

The song and artist name is retrieved from the user through [input] tag.
Once the user clicks the [button] "Search", the function findTrack(track, artist) will be called. 
By connecting to last.fm's API, jQuery's method getJSON() is used to find the corresponding artist image and link to the song on last.fm's website.
